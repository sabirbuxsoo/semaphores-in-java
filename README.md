Semaphores in Java

This program is a multithreaded Java simulation of customers entering a shop under Covid19 pandemic level three regulations, using synchronization mechanisms to ensure that it operates within the specified synchronization
constraints.

The aim of this program is to produce a simple Java simulation of a shop of a specified size. In this simulation, a shop is represented as a grid and customers (each have different colours and unique id numbers) arrive at random times through a single entrance door. On entering the shop, customers first browse (some customers move faster than others) and then head for the checkout. After checkout they leave. The counters at the bottom of the simulation window keep accurate track of the people waiting to enter the venue, those inside, and those who have left. The pause button pauses/resumes the simulation.
